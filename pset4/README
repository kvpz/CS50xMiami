copy.c:
A program that creates a copy of a BMP, piece by piece. The difference
between this program and the cmd command 'cp' is that this throws away
the trailing zeroes found at the end of some BMPs.


whodunit.c:
This is a program (written for pset4 from cs50) that will reveal the image
of Mr. Boddy found in the noisy image file clue.bmp. The clear image of
Mr. Boddy should be store in verdict.bmp. 


smiley.bmp file description:
It is 8 pixels wide by 8 pixels tall, and it's a 24-bit BMP(each of whose
pixels is represented with 24/8 = 3 bytes). Each row (aka "scanline") thus
takes up (8 pixels)x(3 bytes per pixel) = 24 bytes, which happens to be a 
multiple of 4.
Since it is 8 by 8, it takes up 14 + 40 + (8 × 8) × 3 = 246 bytes on disk.

To show the underlying bytes that compose smiley.bmp:
xxd -c 24 -g 3 -s 54 smiley.bmp

This command allows you to see the metadata in addition to the bitmap:
xxd -c 24 -g 3 smiley.bmp

NOTES: 
- Each pixel is 3 bytes.

- The argument following the flag -c represents how many bytes are to 
  be displayed on each row of the xxd output. 

- BMPs are stored differently if the number of bytes in a scanline is not
  a multiple of 4. Example: for a BMP (such as small.bmp) that is 3x3, each
  scanline thus takes up 9 bytes (not a multiple of 4!). In this case, 
  3 bytes worth of zeroes are padding each line.

- If the file actually contained ASCII characters, you'd see them in xxd's
  rightmost column instead of the apparent dots.
