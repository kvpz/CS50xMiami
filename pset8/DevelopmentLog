+ Working on custom icons for the map markers. I was able to display regular markers, but to display a
custom marker from 'https://maps.google.com/mapfiles/kml/pal2/icon31.png', I received a 403 error:
"You don't have permission to access /js/markerwithlabel_packed.js line 1 &gt; eval on this server."

I initially resolved the problem by referring to the Original solution of this post. Changes to httpd.conf were made.
